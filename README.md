This project demonstrates how to analyze potentially phishing emails using various cybersecurity tools, including MXToolbox and VirusTotal. The goal is to understand email headers, perform domain and link analysis, and scan attachments to detect malicious behavior or phishing attempts.

Tools Used
MXToolbox: Used for analyzing email headers to check for authentication issues like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC alignment.
VirusTotal: Scans links and attachments to check if they are flagged by multiple antivirus engines or identified as suspicious.
Steps for Email Analysis
Step 1: Analyze Email Headers
Extract the email headers and run them through MXToolbox.
MXToolbox checks SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to ensure the email is authentic and not spoofed.
Key findings include:
SPF Authentication: Passed
DKIM Authentication: Passed
DMARC Compliance: Failed (due to SPF misalignment).
Step 2: Scan Links and Attachments
Using VirusTotal, I scanned all links and attachments present in the email.
Result: All links and attachments came out clean across multiple security vendors, but additional caution is advised.
Step 3: Interpret Results
Even if VirusTotal shows that files and links are safe, always consider other indicators, such as email header anomalies or suspicious content, that may suggest phishing.
Key Findings
MXToolbox revealed potential issues with DMARC compliance, signaling the possibility of email spoofing.
VirusTotal scans confirmed that links and attachments were clean, but the email's failure to align with DMARC raised a red flag.
Lessons Learned
Always check SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records before trusting an email.
Tools like MXToolbox and VirusTotal help identify red flags, but context mattersâ€”clean scans don't guarantee safety.
Phishing emails may still appear clean but have underlying issues like failed DMARC alignment.
