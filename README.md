# Phishing Email Analysis

This project aims to identify phishing threats in email communications by using tools like **MXToolbox** and **VirusTotal**. 

## Tools Used:
1. **MXToolbox** - Validates email headers for any suspicious activity, including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC misconfigurations.
2. **VirusTotal** - Scans links and attachments in emails to check for malicious content using multiple security vendors.

## Project Workflow:
1. **Email Header Analysis:** 
   - The email header is analyzed to detect any anomalies, ensuring that the email's origin and routing are legitimate.
   - Key checks include SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) status checks.
  
2. **Link and Attachment Scanning:** 
   - All links and attachments within the email are sent to VirusTotal for detailed scanning.
   - VirusTotal checks the links and attachments against a wide range of antivirus and security tools to identify any known threats.

## Features:
- **Email Header Validation:** Automatically checks for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC issues.
- **Link Scanning:** Each link within the email is scanned for potential threats.
- **Attachment Scanning:** All email attachments are checked for viruses, malware, and other security risks.
- **Security Vendor Analysis:** VirusTotal integrates multiple security vendors to ensure a comprehensive threat detection process.

## How It Works:
1. **Submit Email Details:** The email header and content are submitted to the analysis tools.
2. **Analysis by MXToolbox:** The email's authentication records are reviewed for any misconfigurations or signs of phishing.
3. **VirusTotal Scanning:** Links and attachments are cross-checked for malicious activity.
4. **Reporting:** A report is generated that highlights any suspicious findings or signs of phishing.

## How to Use:
- **Step 1:** Copy the email header and paste it into the designated input form.
- **Step 2:** Use the link and attachment scan feature to send any suspicious URLs or files to VirusTotal.
- **Step 3:** Review the results and take appropriate action based on the analysis.

## Conclusion:
By analyzing the email headers and scanning the contents with VirusTotal, this project provides a simple yet effective way to identify phishing emails and enhance cybersecurity awareness. Itâ€™s a crucial tool for anyone dealing with email security.
